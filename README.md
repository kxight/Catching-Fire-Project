# Catching-Fire-Project
## Description
PVP Game Development Project is a multiplayer game development project. The game is a top-down perspective game. Players are divided into two teams and compete to kill their opponents. To win, players must employ strategic preparation and teamwork. Players can choose which teams and characters they want to play at the start of the game. Each character will be armed with a weapon that has a range of attacks, a level of damage, and the frequency of shooting vary. To balance their strikes appropriately, players must have a plan. And they must work together as a team to seize and employ in-game item resources to the team's benefit.
